README for `viterbi-bench`
==========================
viterbi-bench benchmarks a set of variations of the Viterbi
algorithm implemented in MRFy. viterbi-bench requires that
the MRFY_CHECKOUTS_PATH is set to a directory containing
git checkouts of MRFy branches. By default, viterbi-bench
recursively searches the directory for checkouts and runs
the benchmark specified against all of them.

The -b option can be used to specify only some branches to
benchmark.

protip: viterbi-bench [ args ] | column -t
         
-smurf   When set, "smurf" is run on the benchmark instead
         of mrfy.
         The SMURF_DAT_PATH environment variable must be
         set to the directory containing the "smurf"
         executable and the beta "dat" files.

-s       Benchmark that takes 5-10 seconds.

-m       Benchmark that takes 2 minutes and reports the
         better of two passes for each template.

-l       Benchmark that takes a significant amount of time.
         Reports the best of five passes for each template.

-b "dir-name [ dir-name [ ... ] ]"
         A single string with a space delimited list of
         directory names to run benchmarks on.

-v       Show extra output, like the times for each HMM.

-h       Show this usage information.


README for `mrfy-bench`
=======================
This is a simple benchmarking framework for MRFy.
It is not yet intended for public consumption.
There are four basic variants: `mrfy-bench <-s | -m | -l | -p>`
Short is intended as a microbenchmark; it takes 5-10 seconds on reasonable 
hardware.
Medium takes less than 2 minutes, and takes the better of two passes for each.
Long and Paper take a significant amount of time, running more templates and
choosing the best of 5 runs for each.
The only difference between Long and Paper is that the latter requires SMURF
to be run as well; Long only runs SMURF if either the SMURF_DAT_PATH environment
variable is set, or the path is passed as an argument after `-p`.
Medium runs SMURF under the same criteria as Long.
Note: mrfy and smurf (if it is being run) must be in your path.
